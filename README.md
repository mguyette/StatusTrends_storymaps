The St. Johns River Water Management District produces an annual Water Quality Status & Trends Report to update stakeholders about water quality around the District.  In 2016, I began managing the team responsible for generating these reports and I effected substantial changes to make the report more accessible and interactive.  We transitioned from many static maps to presenting the same information using ArcGIS Online story maps.

This was a true collaborative effort.  The data analyses and summaries are performed annually by one of my quality assurance staff members, who has strong analytical and SAS programming skills.  We then worked closely with IT GIS staff at the District to create the story maps in ArcGIS Online.

I coordinate and manage this project.  I developed initial mock-ups of the story maps, exploring structural options and symbology.  I then worked closely with GIS staff to refine and improve our implementation of these story maps.  I edit and customize the layout, making behind-the-scenes changes when necessary, including using the ArcGIS Online Assistant to make modifications to Web Mapping Application JSON elements.
